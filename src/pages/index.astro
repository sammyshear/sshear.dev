			Hi, I'm Sammy Shear, welcome to my personal site and blog. I'm a
			developer with experience in both Web and Native development, but I
			have been mostly focused on the Web. I have experience in backend
			and frontend. On the frontend I mostly do work in React and Vue (and
			I am partial to HTMX), but over the years I've used many other
			frameworks and technologies in general. On the backend at this point
			I most often use Go's default HTTP server or Rust with Actix Web or
			Axum, but I also have experience with Node and Express, as well as
			RPC using tRPC (a TypeScript RPC implementation).
			<br />
			This site mostly serves as a blog for me to write about things I do or
			am interested in, but I will probably add more uses for the site as I
			think of them.
		</p>
